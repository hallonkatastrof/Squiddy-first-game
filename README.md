To edit any of the files follow this:

1. Download and install Unity.
2. Download all the files and folders as they are in a game directory.
3. Move said directory in to the location of the Unity projects. If not found, try making a new project yourself and see where it's saved.
4. You should now be able to open it through Unity.
